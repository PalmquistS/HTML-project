            A fox is a small mammalian carnivore. They hunt and eat live prey,
            mostly rabbits and rodents (squirrels and mice). They may also eat
            grasshoppers, birds' eggs, and even fruit and berries.
          </p>
          <p>
            Foxes are swift and agile runners which live in family groups. A
            female fox is called a vixen, and a male is called a dog. Foxes'
            tails are multi-purpose organs. Their bushy tail helps them keep
            warm while they are sleeping in cold weather.

            Monkeys are tree-dwelling (arboreal) simians. They are in the
            primate order. Monkeys are intelligent, social animals. Most monkeys
            have a tail, even if it is a short one. The word "monkey" is a
            common-language term which is not used in taxonomy.
          </p>
          <p>
            It includes two rather different groups of primates. The big
            distinction is between Old World monkeys and New World monkeys. Some
            examples of monkeys are macaques, baboons, guenons and marmosets.

            A domestic sheep (Ovis aries) is a domesticated mammal related to
            wild sheep and goats. Sheep are owned and looked after by a sheep
            farmer. Female sheep are called ewes. Male sheep are called rams.
            Young sheep are called lambs. They are kept for their wool and their
            meat.
          </p>
          <p>
            The wool of sheep, after cleaning and treating, is used to make
            woollen clothes. The meat of young sheep is called lamb, and the
            meat from adult sheep is called mutton. Both are economically
            important products which have been used since prehistoric times.

            The clown fish is a kind of fish. Clownfish habitat usually is a
            coral reefs. Clownfish live in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific
            Ocean, from north west Australia, the coast of South East Asia as
            far north as Japan. Often, they live in a symbiosis with other
            animals, for instance the sea anemone.
          </p>
          <p>
            They live in anemones which are like plants under the sea. Anemones
            eat fish by killing them with their tentacles which are poisonous.
            Scientists believe that clown fish are protected from the poison
            because they are coated in a type of mucus.

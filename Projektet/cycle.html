          The enthusiasm for Road cycling competitions began at the end of the
          XIX century and has not stopped growing since. Some big races attract
          around tens of million spectators and are watched by TV viewers all
          over the world.

        <p>
          The first race officially recorded dates back to 31 May 1868 at the
          ‘Parc de Saint-Cloud’, in Paris, and was won by the British rider,
          James Moore.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first city to city race took place on 7 November 1869:
          Paris-Rouen. James Moore, once again the winner, rode 123 kilometres
          in 10h. 25 min. The organisers’ intention was to promote cycling and
          to demonstrate that the bicycle enabled considerable distances to be
          covered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Road cycling has been part of the Olympic Games programme since its
          first edition in 1896.

          From 2019, the team time trial at the UCI Road World Championships
          will be raced in a mixed relay format reserved for national teams
          composed of three men and three women from the Elite and Under-23
          categories. The event will get under way with the three men, who will
          then hand over the relay to the three women.
        </p>
        <p>
          The team’s final placing will be calculated based on the time elapsed
          when the second woman crosses the finish line. The principle is the
          same as for the individual time trial but this event is raced by teams
          of a minimum of 2 riders and a maximum of 10 riders.

          Road race is part of the Olympic programme. The riders start together
          in a bunch. The courses are of varying distances (approx. 260 km for
          Elite Men in the UCI World Championships). Road races have several
          different formats: oneday races from one point to another (eg
          Paris-Roubaix or Tour of Flanders) or on a circuit, such as the UCI
          World Championships or stage races (eg Tour de France, Giro d’Italia
          or Vuelta a España).

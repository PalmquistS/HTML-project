            A company is a type of business. The definition of the term varies
            by country. Some companies, usually larger ones, are organized as
            corporations. It is often a business organization which makes goods
            or services in an organized manner and sells them to the public for
            profit. It may also be a non-profit organization.
          </p>
          <p>
            A company may hire people to be the staff of the company. A business
            is an organization where people work together. In a business, people
            work to make and sell products or services. Other people buy the
            products and services. The business owner is the person who hires
            people for work.

            A business can earn a profit for the products and services it
            offers. The word business comes from the word busy, and means doing
            things.It works on regular basis. Most businesses are created for
            commerce. There are big and small businesses. For example, one
            person can open a small barber-shop.
          </p>
          <p>
            A big business, like Microsoft, employs thousands of people all over
            the world. Some businesses need fixed locations. Examples are an
            office, store, or farm. For some businesses the worker goes to
            different locations. Examples are carpenters or electricians.

            Business can also mean the work or current state of a business. A
            business owner might say: "I am doing a lot of business" or "My
            business is good" or "Business is bad". The term can also be used in
            a more general way. As a noun, it can be used, for example, to speak
            about a broad area of activity.

            The summit is the top of a mountain or hill. In geography, the
            elevation of mountains is measured. The elevation is the difference
            in height between sea level and the top of a mountain or hill. A
            peak is a pointed mountain, though not always.

            A biplane is a fixed-wing aircraft that has two fixed wings. The
            lower wing is often attached to the body of the aircraft and the top
            wing is raised above. Most early airplanes were biplanes because
            they have a stronger structure than a monoplane.
          </p>
          <p>
            When engineers found how to makes strong monoplanes, biplanes became
            rare because they produce more drag.

            Rock climbing is a sport where someone uses their hands and feet to
            climb up a rock or an artificial climbing wall. Rock climbing is a
            very difficult sport because you need to have a lot of strength.
            Rock climbers must know how to use ropes, carabiners and harnesses
            for their own safety.
